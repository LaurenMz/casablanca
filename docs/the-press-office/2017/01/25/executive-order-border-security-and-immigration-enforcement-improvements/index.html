<p>de Immigración</p>
<h1 id="orden-ejecutiva">Orden Ejecutiva</h1>
<hr>
<p>Seguridad en la Frontera y Mejoras a la Aplicación de Leyes de Immigración</p>
<p>Por la autoridad conferida en mi como presidente por la constitución y las
leyes de los Estados Unidos de America, incluyendo el acta de Immigración
y Nacionalidad (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), el acta de asegurar la
frontera de 2006 (Public Law 109 367) (Secure Fence Act), y la reforma a
Immigración Ilegal y Acta de Responsabilidad con Immigrantes de 1996,
(Public Law 104 208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), y en orden de asegurar la seguridad
e integridad territorial de los Estados Unidos y para asegurar que las leyes
de immigración de la nación sean ejecutadas correctamente, yo ordeno lo
siguiente:</p>
<p><strong>Section 1. Proposito.</strong> La seguridad de la frontera es criticamente importante
para la seguridad de los Estados Unidos. Extraños que entran de forma ilegal
a los Estados Unidos sin inspección o admisión presentan una amenaza a la seguridad
nacional y la seguridad pública. Tales extranjeros no han sido identificados o
inspeccionados por oficiales de immigración para determinar su admisibilidad
a los Estados Unidos. El reciente crecimiento en immigración ilegal en la
frontera del sur con Mexico ha agregado una carga a los recursos federales y
abrumado a las agencias a cargo de la seguridad en la frontera y aplicación de
la ley de immigración, al igual que en las comunidades locales donde estos
extraños residen.</p>
<p>Organizaciones criminales transnacioanles operan redes de trafico de drogas
y personas en ambos lados de la frontera en el sur, contribuyendo de manera
significante a un incremento en violencia y muertes en los Estados Unidos
por drogas peligrosas. Entre los que ingresan de forma ilegal hay quienes
buscan herir a los americanos con actos de terror y su conducta criminal.
La continuación de la immigración ilegal presenta un grave daño a los
intereses de Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means
for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the
Nation&#39;s southern border.  Although Federal immigration law provides a robust
framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws
and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our
borders    the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign
responsibility.  The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments
and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation&#39;s
southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States,
and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to:</p>
<p>(a)  secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate
construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported
by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human
trafficking, and acts of terrorism;</p>
<p>(b)  detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State
law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding
those violations;</p>
<p>(c)  expedite determinations of apprehended individuals&#39; claims of eligibility
to remain in the United States;</p>
<p>(d)  remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the
United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or
criminal sanctions have been imposed; and</p>
<p>(e)  cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting
Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well
as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law
and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.</p>
<p>Sec. 3.  Definitions.  (a)  &quot;Asylum officer&quot; has the meaning given the term in
section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).</p>
<p>(b)  &quot;Southern border&quot; shall mean the contiguous land border between the United
States and Mexico, including all points of entry.</p>
<p>(c)  &quot;Border States&quot; shall mean the States of the United States immediately
adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>(d)  Except as otherwise noted, &quot;the Secretary&quot; shall refer to the Secretary of
Homeland Security.</p>
<p>(e)  &quot;Wall&quot; shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure,
contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.</p>
<p>(f)  &quot;Executive department&quot; shall have the meaning given in section 101 of
title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p>(g)  &quot;Regulations&quot; shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and
directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.</p>
<p>(h)  &quot;Operational control&quot; shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries
into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens,
instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.</p>
<p>Sec. 4.  Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States.  The
Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete
operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:</p>
<p>(a)  In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and
IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a
physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and
technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the
southern border;</p>
<p>(b)  Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of
Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall
along the southern border;</p>
<p>(c)  Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including
preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal
years; and</p>
<p>(d)  Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to
be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current
state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of
the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary
to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy
to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.</p>
<p>Sec. 5.  Detention Facilities.  (a)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate
action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct,
operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control
facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.</p>
<p>(b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally
available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration
detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and
conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the
INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear
determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.</p>
<p>(c)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all
legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to
immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or
operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose
of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II,
United States Code.</p>
<p>Sec. 6.  Detention for Illegal Entry.  The Secretary shall immediately take all
appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for
violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings
or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law.  The
Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland
Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful
detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice
commonly known as &quot;catch and release,&quot; whereby aliens are routinely released in
the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of
immigration law.</p>
<p>Sec. 7.  Return to Territory.  The Secretary shall take appropriate action,
consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States
Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8
U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came
pending a formal removal proceeding.</p>
<p>Sec. 8.  Additional Border Patrol Agents.  Subject to available appropriations,
the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection,
shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol
agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and
are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 9.  Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements.  The head of each executive
department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and
indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual
basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral
development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department
and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State.  Within 60
days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a
consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has
been provided annually, over each of the past five years.</p>
<p>Sec. 10.  Federal-State Agreements.  It is the policy of the executive branch
to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to
perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United
States to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>(a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take
appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local
officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section
287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).</p>
<p>(b)  To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local
officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through
agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State
and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified
and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation
to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States
under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary.  Such authorization
shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these
duties.</p>
<p>(c)  To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement
under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective
model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control
over the border for that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Sec. 11.  Parole, Asylum, and Removal.  It is the policy of the executive
branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to
prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.</p>
<p>(a)  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that
the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally
exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.</p>
<p>(b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating
any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear
determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1))
and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31,
are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those
provisions.</p>
<p>(c)  Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall
take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the
provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens
designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).</p>
<p>(d)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole
authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised
only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the
statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent
humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.</p>
<p>(e)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department
of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application
of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection
Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the
Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that
unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care
and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and,
when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Sec. 12.  Authorization to Enter Federal Lands.  The Secretary, in conjunction
with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as
necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:</p>
<p>(a)  permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all
State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all
Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and</p>
<p>(b)  enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all
State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such
actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to
implement this order.</p>
<p>Sec. 13.  Priority Enforcement.  The Attorney General shall take all
appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate
resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to
prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border.</p>
<p>Sec. 14.  Government Transparency.  The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and
in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at
or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all
Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily
understandable by the public.</p>
<p>Sec. 15.  Reporting.  Except as otherwise provided in this order, the
Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General,
within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of
the directives contained in this order.</p>
<p>Sec. 16.  Hiring.  The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate
action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this
order.</p>
<p>Sec. 17.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p>(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the
head thereof; or</p>
<p>(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p>(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject
to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p>(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit,
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against
the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers,
employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
