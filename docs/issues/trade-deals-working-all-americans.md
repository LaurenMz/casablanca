#   Acuerdos de Comercio Trabajando Para Todo Americanos

Por mucho tiempo, Americanos se han visto obligados de acceptar acuerdos de comercio que pone los intereses de los que

estan enterados y los élite de Washington sobre los intereses de hombres y mujeres trabajadores de este pais.

El resultado, los pueblos y cuidades industriales han visto cerrar sus fábricas y sus trabajos bien pagados mover al extranjero.

Ademas de estos cambios, Americanos se encuentran con una falta de comercio y un debil base de fabricación.

With a lifetime of negotiating experience, the President understands how critical it is to put American workers

and businesses first when it comes to trade. With tough and fair agreements, international trade can be used to

grow our economy, return millions of jobs to America’s shores, and revitalize our nation’s suffering communities.

This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade

deals are in the interests of American workers. President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA.

If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give

notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA.

In addition to rejecting and reworking failed trade deals, the United States will crack down on those nations
that violate trade agreements and harm American workers in the process. The President will direct the Commerce

Secretary to identify all trade violations and to use every tool at the federal government’s disposal to end

these abuses.

To carry out his strategy, the President is appointing the toughest and smartest to his trade team, ensuring

that Americans have the best negotiators possible. For too long, trade deals have been negotiated by, and for,

members of the Washington establishment. President Trump will ensure that on his watch, trade policies will be

implemented by and for the people, and will put America first.

By fighting for fair but tough trade deals, we can bring jobs back to America’s shores, increase wages, and

support U.S. manufacturing.
